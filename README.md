AI Powered Transaction categorising Excel Add-in

## Summary

This repo houses instructions to add two Excel add-ins that can be used to label transactions from Investec's programmable banking. 

- The first add-in uses a simple rule-based engine: https://gist.github.com/Vutlhari/fbb2b22d3b53464b47c96b3f04e6a863

- The second add-in uses GPT-3: https://gist.github.com/Vutlhari/ab680d514bd912c4956b4b58c714be18

_Please note that this is expensive because the prompt data is sent with each request._ 

This repository is submitted as part of the OfferZen Q2 2022 Hackathon. Please note that the code for the add-ins sits in public gists - liked in SETUP.md. The GPT-3 add-in uses an API that is currently sitting on replit. You can request access to the api code, which will be publicised afte the hackathon. 

_Please note that I have a custom trained model that will be used when I continue working on this project._
